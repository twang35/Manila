[Manila Grades Web Page](http://manilagrades.com/index.php)


Manila is a suite that provides both students and professors easy access to their gradebooks. The gradebook compiles data inputted by a professor into a webpage that performs numerous statistical analyses on the data. Some models include a bell curve of the class performance, z-score of a test, and Naive-Bayes classifier. The page can also let a student know what their performance needs to be in order to achieve their desired grade. The page visualizes small details like a course's grade breakdown (pulled from a syllabus) so that students can evaluate what assignments to spend more effort on.
